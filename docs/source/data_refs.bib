            abstract = {Analyzing the variance of complex computer models is an
                        essential practice to assess and improve that model by
                        identifying the influential parameters that cause the
                        output variance. Variance-based sensitivity analysis is
                        the process of decomposing the output variance into
                        components associated with each input parameter. In this
                        study, we applied a new concept of variance-based
                        sensitivity analysis inspired by the game theory proposed
                        by Shapley. The technique is called the Shapley effect,
                        and it investigates the contribution of each input
                        parameter as well as its interactions with every other
                        parameter in the system by exploring all possible
                        permutations between them. The Shapley effect is compared
                        to the common Sobol indices technique (first order and
                        total effects) to investigate their performance under
                        correlated and uncorrelated parameters. The Shapley
                        effect demonstrated superior performance when compared to
                        the Sobol indices for correlated input parameters.
                        Shapley effect captured the correlation between the input
                        parameters, expressing the variance contribution in a
                        single index instead of two indices, and normalization of
                        the fractional indices is preserved without over or
                        underestimation. On the other hand, the two algorithms we
                        selected to calculate Sobol indices under correlated
                        inputs experienced different issues including:
                        over/underestimating the output variance, first order
                        effect could be larger than the total effect, possibility
                        of negative indices, unnormalized fractional indices, and
                        difficulty to interpret the results. However, Sobol
                        showed satisfactory performance when the inputs are
                        uncorrelated as the numerical values and input ranking
                        were in good agreement with Shapley effect. The main
                        disadvantage of Shapley effect is its large computational
                        cost especially for high dimensional problems where the
                        number of possible input subsets becomes very large. The
                        results of our tests showed that the thermal fission
                        cross-section carried most of the uncertainty at BOL, and
                        its contribution declines after fuel burnup, which is
                        replaced by the uncertainty contribution of the fast
                        cross-section parameters.},

                        computational modeling through high-fidelity and
                        multiphysics simulations add more challenges on assessing
                        their predictive capability. In this work, metamodeling
                        or surrogate modeling through deep Gaussian processes
                        (DeepGP) is performed to construct surrogates of advanced
                        computer simulations drawn from the nuclear engineering
                        area. This work is centered around three major ideas: (1)
                        surrogate modeling through deep Gaussian processes
                        (DeepGP), (2) simulation assessment through
                        surrogate-based uncertainty quantification (UQ)
                        methodologies, and (3) drawing conclusions regarding the
                        underlying uncertainty of the four simulations considered
                        in this paper. First, DeepGP models are trained,
                        optimized, and validated to yield variety of features:
                        (1) achieving high accuracy (small error metrics) on the
                        validation set, (2) automatically capturing the surrogate
                        model uncertainty (i.e. interpolation errors), (3)
                        fitting multiple outputs with different scales
                        simultaneously, (4) handling high dimensional input
                        spaces, and (5) learning from small data amounts. Second,
                        the validated DeepGP surrogates are utilized to
                        efficiently perform UQ tasks such as uncertainty
                        propagation (through Monte Carlo sampling), parameter
                        screening (through Morris screening), and variance
                        decomposition (through Sobol Indices) to investigate the
                        selected simulations. Third, the thermal-hydraulics
                        (fluid flow) results demonstrate the importance of inlet
                        temperature uncertainty in void fraction predictions. For
                        the reactor physics application (fuel
                        depletion/consumption), DeepGP accurately captures the
                        uncertainty in criticality calculations, which is about
                        0.6% (i.e. a considerable value for this application).
                        For the application of kinetic parameters (nuclear data),
                        DeepGP successfully explains 95% or more of the variance
                        in all 12 outputs. Finally, DeepGP-based UQ analysis of
                        the fuel performance application (materials science)
                        shows the importance of the clad surface temperature,
                        fuel porosity, and linear heat rate in explaining the
                        variance of the maximum fuel centerline and surface
                        temperatures.},

                        generation, and many others. However, sensitive
                        engineering areas such as nuclear engineering benefited
                        less from these efficient techniques. In this work, deep
                        learning expert systems are utilized to model and predict
                        time series progression of a design-basis nuclear
                        accident, featuring a loss of coolant accident. Two major
                        findings are accomplished in this work. First, the
                        ability to train expert systems with high accuracy, which
                        could help nuclear power plant operators to figure out
                        plant responses during the accident. Second, building
                        fast, efficient, and accurate deep models to simulate
                        nuclear phenomena, which could be valuable to nuclear
                        computational science. In this work, large amount of time
                        series data is obtained from simulation tools by
                        simulating different conditions of the base-case/nominal
                        accident scenario. Four critical outputs/responses are
                        monitored during the accident (e.g. temperature, pressure
                        , break flow rate, water level). Two approaches are
                        adopted in this work. The first approach is to use
                        feedforward deep neural networks (DNN) to fit all time
                        steps and outputs in a single model. The second approach
                        is to use long short-term memory (LSTM) to fit all time
                        steps together for each reactor response separately. Both
                        DNN and LSTM demonstrate very good performance in
                        predicting the test and base-case scenarios, with
                        accuracy as low as 92% and as high as 99%, where these
                        test scenarios are unknown to the expert systems and are
                        not included in the model training. In addition, both
                        approaches demonstrate a significant reduction in
                        computational costs, as the deep expert system is able to
                        accurately predict the accident 100,000 times faster than
                        the original simulation tool. Given sufficient data, the
                        methodology adopted in this study demonstrates that
                        DNN/LSTM expert systems can be used as a decision support
                        system to model advanced time series phenomena within
                        nuclear power plants with high accuracy and negligible
                        computational costs.},

                        there is a need for automated and optimal control of these
                        reactors. This paper presents a methodology for performing
                        multiobjective optimization of control drum operation for a
                        microreactor under normal and off-nominal conditions. Two
                        different case studies are used where the control drum 
                        configuration is optimized for the reactor to be critical
                        with some desired power distribution that would satisfy
                        peaking limits. A surrogate model for power distribution is
                        developed based on a feedforward neural network. The process
                        for determining weights for scalarization of the multiobjective
                        optimization problem is also detailed. Six optimization algorithms:

                        these cases and the results analyzed. Although all these algorithms
                        will demonstrate optima-seeking behavior, for real-time control it is
                        necessary to identify the best algorithm to efficiently provide
                        reasonable optima without operator interference. The moth flame 
                        optimization algorithm was found to perform particularly well on both
                        cases. Overall, it was found that the algorithms capable of supplying
                        the best optima were also the most consistent. Finally, the found optima
                        were verified with the original model used to train surrogates.},

                        works that learn how to assign fuel and poison enrichment by narrowing the search space into the
                        areas where human/physics knowledge demonstrate merit. Evolution strategies diversify the search in
                        these areas, through obtaining guidance from RL candidates. With very efficient/parallel implementation,
                        our optimisation approach is able to solve a coupled multi-zone BWR bundle optimisation with ~40 con-
                        straints. The methodology is applied to a GE14-10x10 bundle, showing the ability of neuroevolution to
                        find ~100 feasible designs. The optimal bundle has 7 axial zones with non-uniform enrichment radially
                        and axially. The results of this work also demonstrate that our neuroevolution methodology is sufficiently
                        generic to adapt to other assembly and reactor designs with minor adjustments.},
