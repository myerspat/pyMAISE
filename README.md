pyMAISE is an artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) benchmarking library for nuclear reactor applications. It offers to streamline the building, tuning, and comparison of various ML models for user-provided data sets. Also, pyMAISE offers benchmarked data sets, such as Jupyter Notebooks, for AI/ML comparison. Current ML algorithm support includes

- linear regression,
- lasso regression,
- logistic regression,
- decision tree regression and classification,
- support vector regression and classification,
- random forest regression and classification,
- k-nearest neighbors regression and classification,
- sequential neural networks.

These models are built using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [Keras](https://keras.io). pyMAISE supports the following neural network layers:

- dense,
- dropout,
- LSTM,
- GRU,
- 1D, 2D, and 3D convolutional,
- 1D, 2D, and 3D max pooling,
- flatten,
- and reshape.
